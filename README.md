# Political Bias Detector
A machine learning project that quickly classifies articles as left-wing or right-wing based on their political bias.

# Introduction
In today's world, it can be difficult to know what information you can trust. With the proliferation of fake news and misinformation, it's important to have tools that can help you determine the political bias of an article. That's where Political Bias Detector comes in.

Political Bias Detector is a machine learning project that analyzes the text of an article and compares it to a database of keywords and their political affiliations. The result is a clear and accurate determination of whether the article is left-wing or right-wing.

# How it works
The algorithm uses natural language processing techniques to extract the text from an article URL, preprocess the text, and compare it to a database of keywords and their political affiliations. The database of keywords and affiliations was created using a CSV file. The algorithm then uses a simple counting approach to determine the political leaning of the article based on the presence and frequency of keywords.
